Reviewers: ML Strategy Team, Data Quality, Legal

Executive Summary The rise of agentic AI systems necessitates robust planning capabilities across multiple domains and time horizons. This document outlines the comprehensive requirements for creating a high-quality planning corpus that will enable next-generation AI systems to develop sophisticated planning strategies while maintaining appropriate safety guardrails. The corpus will serve as a foundation for training models that can decompose complex tasks, manage dependencies, and adapt to changing conditions.
Background and Context
2.1 Market Analysis

The agentic AI market has shown significant growth in Q3 2024:

47% increase in demand for planning-capable systems
3.2x growth in deployment of agentic AI in enterprise settings
$4.2B projected market size by 2025
Key competitors have released 5 major updates in past 6 months See Appendix A for detailed market research report.
2.2 Technical Context and Historical Background

Previous iterations of planning corpora have demonstrated several limitations:

V1.0 (2023 Q2): 78% accuracy but temporal consistency issues
V1.5 (2023 Q4): Improved to 82% but limited scope
V2.0 (2024 Q1): Added multi-step planning but suffered from goal drift
V2.1 (2024 Q2): Introduced safety constraints, reduced effectiveness
V2.2 (2024 Q3): Balanced safety and effectiveness, still needs improvement
V2.3 (2024 Q3): Rejected due to data quality issues
2.3 Strategic Alignment

This project aligns with corporate objectives:

Innovation leadership in AI safety
Market expansion in enterprise AI
Technical capability development
Revenue growth targets for Q4 2024 and beyond
Dataset Requirements and Specifications
