In this project you are parsing a variety of communications, each has their own format.
For highly specified functionality, we will be creating more specific parsers for each of the individual formats.
This will allow us to extract information with a precision that will allow for easier processing and usability later on.
each section describes the formats, 

at the end of each section there is an array that demonstrates what each entry should contain and look like after passing through the parser.
you will notice each data array has 'links' included.. this means to include an array of ANY and ALL links mentioned in the entry. we want to ensure the parser does not miss any links in the program as these are crucial documents like guidelines

---------

Slack Has two types of messages; Direct Message, and Channel

Direct Messages has this format:
"From: Name -> Name" and are followed by the text "Direct Message" then "Date:"

Channel Messages have this format:
"From: Name" and are followed by "Channel: Channel name"

The message content is then in "Message: *message content*"

each slack message should have [date, (DM or Channel), recipient or channel name, message content, links]



---------

Emails

Emails have a pretty universal format:
"From: *sender*"
"To: *recipient*"
"Subject: *subject*"

Meeting Notes can have come in two different forms, from through slack or through other format. 

Slack format:

"content (usually under 'Message:'): *meeting note content*"

OTher format:
"Meeting Minutes: *meeting name*"
"Date: *date*"
"Attendees: *attendees*"
"Location: *location*"
"content: *content*"

Meeting through the slack format are daily standups and should be categorized as such. Stand ups has the formatted sections "Completed:","In Progress:", "Blockers:", and "Notes:" that can easily be parsed and clustered.
Meeting notes that are not daily standups typically has the formatted sections "Agenda:", "Notes:", "Action Items:", "Next Meeting:".

Formatted sections are usually denoted with a ':'

[date, "Daily Standup" or meeting name, location (if not specified put Virtual or something), content, links]
