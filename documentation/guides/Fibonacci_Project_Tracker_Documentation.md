Deployment Instructions

Google Apps Script Setup
1. Create new Google Apps Script project
2. Upload all .js files from created_artifacts/
3. Update configuration:
   const CONFIG = {
     SPREADSHEET_ID: 'YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE',
     DRIVE_FOLDER_NAME: 'ProjectCommunications'
   };
4. Set up Google Drive folder with communication files
5. Run the main function: processAndUpdateAllSheets()

Google Sheets Setup

Parsing Specifications

Communication Format Standards
Detailed parsing rules are documented in formatting_guidelines.txt:
• Slack Messages: Direct messages vs channel messages
• Email Communications: Standard header parsing
• Meeting Notes: Stand-ups vs formal meetings
• Calendar Invites: Event details and attendee extraction
• Support Tickets: Issue tracking with conversation logs
• Technical Specs: Document structure analysis

Link Extraction
All parsers are configured to extract ANY and ALL links mentioned in communications, as these often contain crucial documents like guidelines and data sources.

Project Name Recognition
The system recognizes projects through:
• Exact name matching
• Common abbreviations (RLHF, SFT, etc.)
• Context-based identification
• Volume and timeline associations

Scaling Considerations

Current Implementation (8 projects)
• Google Sheets with Apps Script automation
• Manual trigger for processing
• Real-time dashboard updates

Scaling Architecture (100x projects)
• Database: PostgreSQL with proper indexing
• API Layer: RESTful API for programmatic access
• Real-time Updates: WebSocket connections
• Processing: Automated ingestion pipeline

Performance Optimization
• Batch processing for large datasets
• Incremental updates for new communications
• Caching for frequently accessed data
• API rate limiting for external integrations

Customization Guide

1. Define format in formatting_guidelines.txt
2. Add parser in 03_communication_parser.js
3. Update extractor in 02_data_extractors.js
4. Test with sample data

Modifying Project Recognition
1. Update patterns in 04_project_name_extractor.js
2. Add new project types or naming conventions
3. Test recognition accuracy

Dashboard Customization
1. Modify HTML templates for different layouts
2. Update CSS for branding
3. Add new chart types or data visualizations

Usage Notes

LLM Usage Disclosure
Large language models were used for:
• Initial communication parsing pattern recognition
• Data structure optimization suggestions
• Code generation assistance

All final logic and automation was human-written and validated against the provided data.

Data Sources
All analysis based on the provided mock communications in the provided materials/ folder. The system is designed to work with real communication exports in the same formats.

Maintenance
• Regular updates to project name recognition patterns
• Periodic validation of parsing accuracy
• Monitoring of system performance as data volume grows

This technical implementation provides a complete solution for transforming scattered project communications into centralized, actionable intelligence through automated parsing and structured data presentation.
